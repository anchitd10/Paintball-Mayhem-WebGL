# Paintball-Mayhem-WebGL
## Description

Paintball Mayhem is a WebGL-based game where players control a shooter at the bottom of the screen. Blocks fall from the top, and players can shoot paintballs to paint them. The game includes dynamic difficulty, increasing the speed of falling blocks over time, and features a scoring system based on the number of blocks destroyed.

## Features

- **Shooter Control**: Move the shooter left and right using arrow keys.
- **Shooting Projectiles**: Shoot projectiles using the space bar. You can shoot multiple projectiles in quick succession.
- **Falling Blocks**: Blocks spawn at random positions at the top of the screen and fall towards the shooter.
- **Collision Detection**: If a projectile hits a block, the block is destroyed, and the score increases. If a block reaches the bottom of the screen, the game ends.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The speed of falling blocks increases over time, making the game more challenging.
- **Score Tracking**: The current score is displayed on the screen, and the game alerts the player with their final score upon losing.
